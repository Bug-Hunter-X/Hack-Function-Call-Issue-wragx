# Hack Function Call Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in a simple Hack function call. The function `bar` calls `foo`, but the result is incorrect. The expected output is 12, but the actual output is different.  This could be due to type issues, unexpected function behavior, or other subtle Hack-specific problems.

The `bug.hack` file contains the buggy code, and the `bugSolution.hack` file contains the corrected code.
